## The Overall Structure of the Code
What do different modules and files do?
**Assets** - The Assets module contains image files used throughout the entire PTSD app.
**ChatBot**- The ChatBot module houses the frame work for a somewhat working chatbot.
**Components**- The Components module has components used in screen.
**Navigation**- The navigation is the root module that handles navigation across the entire application.
**Screens**- The screen module contains all screens used in the application.

What are the major functions?
The application has a Hotline call button for users to communicate with the national PSTD services. The app also
provides users with information through links about support actives and popular PTSD questions that people frequently ask. 
It also a thermometer rates the level of the users PTSD stress level and based on their input directs them to either a crisis line
or their activity. 

What external libraries did you use and why?
Whe used the expo web browser, expo status bar, vector icons, simple chat, and react-navigation. 
**Expo web browser**- opens websites within the appilaction without going to an external web brower.
**Expo status bar** - Provides space 
**Vector Icons** - were used to provide icons for the header and footer components through the applications.
